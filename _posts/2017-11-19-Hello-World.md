So, perhaps I now have ultimately set up a blog with Jekyll for no other reason but to channel my tendencies of uncontrolled Twitter rant chains into a more secluded, personally moderated space so that people who don't really want to see my convuluting (or perhaps downright controversial) opinion pieces on their main pages, so that's fine. 

What you'd expect from this blog is exactly what you'd expect from my Twitter: A discussion on public transport, trams, ponies, aviation, geopolitics, the world of desperately trying to grasp information systems, informatics and computer sciences, as well as small, light pieces of reminders of the world we live in should any situations in the future ever necessitate my rants to take such directives.

Anyway, close your browsers before you are subject to more ranting, folks.
