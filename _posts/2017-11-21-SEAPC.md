title: Project SEAPonyCon&#58; A Reflection, Three Months Later.
---



On the weekend of 19-20 August, 2017, the magnum opus of this collective dreams and vision, coupled with efforts of relentless vigor ~~and continuous flow of caffeine~~, came to fruition as the culmination of the Southeast Asian *My Little Pony* fandom community spirit, on it's declaratively most internationally involved gathering, Project SEAPonyCon. 

And to think it passed by after the years of envisioning, fantasizing, and then finally putting things in motion following the different streams and trials of conventions in the region, only for it to be behind us all for an excess of 90 days.
