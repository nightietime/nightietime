# The Public Case of Public Transport: Reflections of the Way We Think About PT

----
Key motive: PT ain't gonna fix itself if we don't fix up our perspective and our awareness of it first. Public Transport is only effective with direct and effective involvement of those that use it. Including the public participation and the public voice in the development public transport is what would provide pressure to those who are actually involved in building, provisioning, and maintaining public transport.

However, this doesn't mean that everyone gets a bus stop in front of their house. Public discourse should be healthy and consider, in the most mature manner possible, the best tradeoffs between NIMBYfags going crazy and the realistic capabilities of the authorities. It's imperative to put pressure, especially towards political parties who actually get to allocate money to further development, rather than just lamenting and lashing out to public transport authorities that are sometimes held back simply by the politics that determines its fate. For this to work, it is also within the best interests of the society that governments and transport authorities treat their data as openly as possible, so that anyone can come, analyize, and comment on the services being ran, to nurture healthy public debate.
