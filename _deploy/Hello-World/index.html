<p>What you’d expect from this blog is exactly what you’d expect from my Twitter: A discussion on public transport, trams, ponies, aviation, geopolitics, the world of desperately trying to grasp information systems, informatics and computer sciences, as well as small, light pieces of reminders of the world we live in should any situations in the future ever necessitate my rants to take such directives.</p>

<p>Anyway, close your browsers before you are subject to more ranting, folks.</p>
